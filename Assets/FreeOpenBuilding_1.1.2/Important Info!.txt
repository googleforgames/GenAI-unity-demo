if you whant to use navMesh, then you have to uncheck the "Navigation Static" checkbox
of every LOD_2 building object in your "Navigation/Object" tab.

or you can directly click on the LOD_2 object, and in the inspector/right of the "Static" checkbox 
is a small arrow. click on that and uncheck "Navigation Static" before you bake the navigation areas.
